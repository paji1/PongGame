Steps:

• getUser data as an object then pass it to the dashboard components

Profil div:
  • check if user is the profil owner or a visitor
    _ render it's status
    - then render the status either as text area or a simple text.

Achievements: (needs to be seeded!)
  • check if user is the profil owner or a visitor
    - render the achieved trophies in color and the unachieved ones in black and white

Stats: (needs to be seeded!)
  • figure out a way to sort that shit by time stamp (Monthly) | Hint: use (lte && gte) in prisma

LeaderBoard:
  • check if user is the profil owner or a visitor
  • import data from db sorted by highest experience_points, one including all users and second including user's friends only.
  • render the global leaderboard following that logic.
  • render the friends leaderBoard if the user is the owner of that profil.

History:
  • loop over the match history of each user and count the [winner|loser|draws] id's
  • both [-1] => draw 

Achievements: (needs to be seeded!)
